Shapeshifter is an Elixir library for switching between Bitcoin transaction formats. Quickly and simply shift between raw tx binaries, `BSV.Transaction` structs, and `TXO` and `BOB` transaction formats.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `shapeshifter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:shapeshifter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Using Shapeshifter couldn't be simpler. Under the hood Shapeshifter uses pattern matching to automatically determine the source format, so all you need to do is pass a transaction object of any format to the appropriate function of the format you want to convert to (from: `to_raw/2`, `to_tx/1`, `to_txo/1` or `to_bob/1`).

```elixir
# Convert to raw tx
Shapeshifter.to_raw(tx)
# => <<1, 0, 0, 0, ...>>

# Convert to raw tx with hex encoding
Shapeshifter.to_raw(tx, encoding: :hex)
# => "01000000..."

# Convert to BSV.Transaction struct
Shapeshifter.to_tx(tx)
# => %BSV.Transaction{}

# Convert to TXO map
Shapeshifter.to_txo(tx)
# => %{"in" => [...], "out" => [...], ...}

# Convert to BOB map
Shapeshifter.to_bob(tx)
# => %{"in" => [...], "out" => [...], ...}
```

For more advanced use, Shapeshifter can also be used to convert individual inputs and outputs between the supported formats.
